Stockflare's not here to help you make a quick buck. Anyone selling that type of *alchemy* is not to be trusted.

But we recognise that many people shy away from investing, feeling that it is too complicated. Little do they know that investing is simple.

Though, the finance industry has little incentive to help people understand how simple investing is. If they did, why would people continue to pay high fees for such poor performance?

But making the leap into investing, isn't easy. So we've designed a [Tutorials](http://learn.stockflare.com) section. It's not just about how to use [Stockflare](http://learn.stockflare.com/stockflare/2014/10/30/A2-what-are-five-star-stocks.html), but also designed to help people understand the whole idea of [Buying Stocks](http://learn.stockflare.com/investing/2014/10/31/B1-should-i-be-buying-shares.html).

These tutorials are not infomercials. But an insight into how we invest ourselves and how we think others should approach investing.

Already, we have 10 tutorials up on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJh-VnCYJojTaCeSa69GPTg/videos) and we've had 8,000 views to date. Here's an example of one such video, where we explain who are the different stock market experts you should follow.

Every tutorial has a slide presentation that you can download. They are at [SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/shaneleonard121). Here's a link to a presentation that helps you work out which sort of investor you are.

But this is just the start. We are refining these tutorials and expanding the list. So if you have a tutorial you'd like us to record, or want to feature in one of our tutorials, please contact us. We'd love to hear what you think.
