### Summary

* Few retail investor got shares in [Alibaba](https://stockflare.com/stocks/BABA.K) at the IPO price of $68.
* Instead they faced a price of over $90.
* At 40x Earnings and Growth forecasts of 29%, Alibaba is not one for me.
* Nor for the Wall Street consensus with a target price of $88.
* And if I owned [Yahoo!](https://stockflare.com/stocks/YHOO.O) stock, I'd be fuming!

### After the IPO

The IPO was a roaring success for Alibaba and its investment banks. But now that the headlines have passed and the first day's trading is closed, what does a retail guy, like me do?

Let's look at the analysis.

Firstly, on **valuation**, it isn't *cheap*.

Secondly, on **fundamentals**, growth in *earnings*, isn't any better than its competitors.

Thirdly, the 2 brokers that have published **research**, pre-IPO, have a *price target* below the 1st day's close.

Though they clearly were fans at the IPO price of $68.

Finally, when it comes to **technicals**, one last word of warning, read about the lock-up agreement in the SEC filing by Alibaba:
* Alibaba sold 368m shares
* Most of the old shareholders agreed to sign the lock-up
* But some, with 128m shares didn't
* Will they now hit the market in an uncontrolled way?
One to watch

### So what's my conclusion?

At first glance, I'm *not interested* in chasing this IPO.

### Any other business?

Separately, though not relevant to Alibaba, I'd be *fuming* if I owned Yahoo! stock. They sold 140m shares only to see the price rise 38% on day 1. Transferring $3bn from Yahoo! stockholders to the IPO buyers. Nice.

In contrast, [Softbank](https://stockflare.com/stocks/9984.T) didn't sell a single share!

**Disclosure**: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in YHOO over the next 72 hours.
