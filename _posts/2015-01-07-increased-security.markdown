At Stockflare, we take the security and privacy of your data very seriously.

To this end, today, we sre introducing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). All Stockflare accounts can activate this feature. MFA is completely free and provides an extra layer of security for your account, helping to ensure that your watchlist or personal data never falls into anybody else's hands.

You can enable MFA for your Stockflare account from the [User Settings](https://stockflare.com/settings) page, using any compatible smartphone. [Find out more here](http://pages.stockflare.com/mfa).

Separately, we recommend that you use a strong password for your account; preferably one automatically generated by a password management tool, such as [Lastpass for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lastpass-free-password-ma/hdokiejnpimakedhajhdlcegeplioahd).

Please drop me a message [@davidkelley87](https://twitter.com/davidkelley87) or message our full team [@stockflare](https://twitter.com/stockflare) if you need any help.
