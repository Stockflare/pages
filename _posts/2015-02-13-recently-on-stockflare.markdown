We've been very busy throughout February, implementing some lovely new features, a mobile app, and fixing up some of those annoying bugs. Here's an update.

We now have a native Stockflare app on the [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/stockflare/id738695952?mt=8), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stockflare.app) and the [Amazon App Store](http://www.amazon.com/Stockflare-Ltd/dp/B00SYWNM7O). Now you can find your next investment on the go.

Bonjour! Stockflare has learnt French. You can choose to view the Stockflare website in French, from the [User Settings](https://stockflare.com/settings) page. Or, if you're web browser is already set to French, you'll start to see Stockflare in French by default. We plan on introducing many more languages in the upcoming months.

We make it our mission to make stock information accessible to everybody, not only those that speak English.

For the avid stock browsers amongst us, you may have noticed that we started displaying information on REITs and ETFs this month. This reflects our continued effort to provide as much information about every stock, to help you easily find and make great investment decisions.
