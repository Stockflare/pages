From [John Neff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Neff), whose Windsor fund beat the market for 30 years.

People who own more than 2 mutual funds are over-diversified. 

The funds themselves are supposed to do the diversification for you, so why buy more than 2. A stock market fund and a bond one? 

Do you have a favourite quote from a famous investor or stock market pundit? We'd love to hear it.
