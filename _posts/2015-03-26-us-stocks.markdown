There are over 10,000 US companies you can invest in, and nearly 700 of them are mega businesses with a value over ten billion dollars. So where do you start? At Stockflare's [Pick Stocks](https://stockflare.com/stocks) obviously!

## What stocks have I got?

Several users have asked how I use Stockflare. So here goes. For me, the stock market isn't just a way to invest, its a way to own part of a great business. What could be better than owning a chuck of a high quality business that's going to grow and grow. It's wonderful knowing that you are backing a team of people that have customers who love their products. 

Today, I've got 18 companies in my US portfolio. They are all [5 star stocks](http://learn.stockflare.com/stockflare/2014/10/30/A2-what-are-five-star-stocks.html) which is how we at Stockflare identify the highest quality businesses. 5 star stocks are businesses that are generating cash, growing and liked by the expert stockbrokers on Wall Street. 

If Wall Street's forecasts hold true, my $26,000 could grow 14% per annum to $64,000 in just seven years. Nice! Hit that growth rate and I'll be sending the CEOs Christmas cards for life.

## Only 18 stocks? 

If you studied economics, you'll have been drilled with the theory of [diversification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversification_%28finance%29#Amount_of_diversification). Or put in simpler words:

> Don't put all your eggs in one basket.

The rule of thumb, [rightly or wrongly](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/11/illusion-of-diversification.asp), is that a portfolio of 30 randomly chosen stocks will track the market. Though legendary investor, Warren Buffett is keen to point out:

> Risk can be greatly reduced by concentrating on only a few holdings.

or

> Wide diversification is only required when investors do not understand what they are doing.

There is no magic to my 18 stocks, but I err on Mr Buffett's side, wanting to own a small number of companies that should stay in my portfolio for years. 

## Finding them?

With 125 US stocks in our 5 star category, there is plenty for me to choose from. What I typically do, is look at each of the ten sectors, i.e. Oils, Industrials, Healthcare, etc. I seek out businesses that fit my personal style, which is [value investing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_investing).

For example, there are only five 5 star stocks in the tech space today. I shy away from super-sized businesses like [Apple](https://stockflare.com/stocks/AAPL.O). The remaining 4 are semi-conductor players, and I picked the one who's products and growth prospects I like the most, [Lam Research](https://stockflare.com/#stocks/LRCX.O). With that in mind, here's the full list.

I've got some real minnows in there. Look at [NN Inc](https://stockflare.com/#stocks/NNBR.O) who manufacture ball bearings or [Alamo](https://stockflare.com/#stocks/ALG) who make lawnmowers. There are even some reasonably big businesses like [Whirlpool](https://stockflare.com/#stocks/WHR) and [Newell Rubbermaid](https://stockflare.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/stocks/NWL). You've heard of them, haven't you. Though you might have to remind yourself.

## What should you do?

Research, of course. That wonderful billionaire with the bow-tie, [Jim Rogers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Rogers) jokes that:

> People spend more time doing research on which car to buy than they do on which stock to buy.

Stockflare's here to give you the tools you need to start your research. But we don't make recommendations or give advice. For the Do-It-Yourself investor who looking to the long-term, the only person to thank (or blame) for a great stock-pick, is *yourself*.

Good luck! And if you are interest in what I'm buying, holding or selling, fear not, I'll be keeping you up to date. Make sure to follow our US Twitter account [@StockflareUS](https://twitter.com/stockflareUS). In fact, I'll let you know what I'm buying before I buy it. Yes, you'll be able to [front-run](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_running) me, if you are so inclined.
