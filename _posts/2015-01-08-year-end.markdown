It's been an exciting 2014, with Stockflare launching at the end of September, and hitting a monthly user figure of over 32,000 users in December. 

Here's what the last 3 months looked like. These are the user figures for each month. With nice reviews at [ProductHunt](http://www.producthunt.com/posts/stockflare), [DesignerNews](https://news.layervault.com/stories/40122-site-design-stockflares-new-landing-page), [Awwwards](http://www.awwwards.com/best-websites/stockflare/) and especially at [LifeHacker](http://twocents.lifehacker.com/stockflare-simplifies-stock-market-data-to-make-investi-1672035079) helping us reach lots of new users.

Better still, if we look at the underlying statistics, in terms of sessions and pageviews we are really happy that:

* Sessions are growing faster than users
* Page views per session is growing
* Time of the site is growing
* And the bounce rate has declined dramatically

The amazing cut in the bounce rate, is entirely driven by our [new landing page](https://stockflare.com/#landing). Please check it out and let us know what you think.

*Aside:* and if you are wondering what "Users (Without C Language)" means, that's went we exclude bots and crawlers from the statistics. We only care to help humans pick stocks, not computers even if they are algo-traders!

Thanks again to everyone who's using Stockflare. Many of you sent feedback to us. We've added a lot of requests to our task list. We are planning lots of improvements. We really appreciate your help.

We hope that 2015 will be a great year, personal and investing, for us all.
