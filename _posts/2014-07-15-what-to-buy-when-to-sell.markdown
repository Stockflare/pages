Stockbrokers and bankers have access to all the financial data in the world. It's expensive and comprehensive with Bloomberg and Reuters making $15 billion a year. 

So it's tragic that few people tell me their broker gives them great stock ideas. Instead people are reading the papers, searching on blogs, and doing the research themselves. 

But it is not easy:

* Yahoo! & Google Finance give you raw data. With no explanation of the figures. For example, even if you know what *Beta* is, why should you care about it?
* News stories from CNBC & CNN Money tell you what a stockbroker or investor thinks. But why should you care what he thinks? Is he impartial? Or any good at picking stocks?
* And sometimes the data is plain wrong. Like when Google Finance showed its own stock down 50% the day of its 2-for-1 stock split.

That's all about to change. 

At Stockflare, we'll give you the tools to make better decisions. You decide *what* to buy and *when* to sell. Stockflare helps you decide quickly and with confidence.

Trust your gut. You know you are right. Let Stockflare prove it to you.

In the next few posts, we'll show you, how easy it is to use Stockflare to find new stock ideas. We'll also show you, how we can tell you if any of the current stocks in your portfolio are terrible!
