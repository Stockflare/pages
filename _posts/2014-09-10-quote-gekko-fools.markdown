From [Gordon Gekko](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Gekko) the Oscar winning Michael Douglas character in [Wall Street](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_(1987_film)).

"A fool and his money are luck enough to get together in the first place."

With the financial markets a great place for them to separate.
