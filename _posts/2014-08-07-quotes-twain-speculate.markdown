From [Mark Twain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twain), author and humorist.

"There are two times in a man's life when he shouldn't speculate: when he can afford to and when he can't."

Despite making a fortune writing, Twain lost it all on [tech investments and setting up a publishing business](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twain#Financial_troubles).
