From [Jesse Livermore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Lauriston_Livermore), aka _the Great Bear of Wall Street_.

"Markets are never wrong, opinions are."

Listen to the opinions of brokers, if you wish, but don't ignore what the market's price is telling you!

Do you have a favourite quote from a famous investor or stock market pundit? We'd love to hear it.
