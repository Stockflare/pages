We take our own medicine here at Stockflare. We use [Pick Stocks](https://stockflare.com/stocks) to find stocks for ourselves. Several users have asked what we own. So here goes. But remember, just because we've fallen in love with a stock, doesn't mean you should. No one has a crystal ball on the future. 

## What's in your portfolio? 

We'd love to know. So to get the ball rolling, here's what's in mine. Today, I've got 15 stocks in my UK account. And if the forecasts of the investment bankers come true, my £15,000 ($23k) could grow to £90,000 ($139k) in 7 years. 29% a year? My oh my, the brokers are being aggressive! If I even got half that, I'd be delighted.

## Wonder stocks?

So what are these wonder stocks that I've bought? They range from homebuilders like [Bovis](https://stockflare.com/#stocks/BVS.L) to the buses at [Stagecoach](https://stockflare.com/#stocks/SGC.L). Pedestrian you might say! Then, there are some tiny companies like [Dialight](https://stockflare.com/#stocks/DIAL.L) who make energy efficient light bulbs and [Cape](https://stockflare.com/stocks/CIU.L) who provide scaffolding and safety services to some of the most dangerous industries in the world!

## How did I pick them?

I'm a value investor at heart. I look for good companies that I think will grow over the long term. And if I can avoid big names, household names, I do. Why? I reckon there's going to be better deals if it's a stock many people ignore. But look at the list again, notice that not all of them are [5 star stocks](http://learn.stockflare.com/stockflare/2014/10/30/A2-what-are-five-star-stocks.html).

## Puzzled?

We don't give advice at Stockflare. Our star rating system is a quality check, yielding businesses that are generating cash, growing and liked by expert stockbrokers. So, hunting outside 5 star stocks is as valid an approach as any.

Plus, the UK doesn't have a lot of 5 star stocks, just 19. And many of them just aren't companies that I like. Here's the full list.

See? There are mega banks like [RBS](https://stockflare.com/#stocks/RBS.L) on the list and a whole collection of Russian businesses like [Norilsk Nickel](https://stockflare.com/stocks/NKELyq.L). And as much as I am tempted to invest in some of these stocks, they are priced in dollars on the London Stock Exchange, so not for my pound account! Yes, even though I like [MD Medical](https://stockflare.com/stocks/MDMGq.L), who are bringing world class maternity care to Russian mothers.

So, with such a small list of the type of stocks I like, I dipped into the 4-star group. Here's the full detail on the 15 UK stocks that I own.

## And the big questions are?

**Firstly**, if you want me to explain why I bought any specific stock, please let me know. I'm happy to explain. 

**Secondly**, if you want to ask if you should buy any of these stocks for yourself, well, there's only one person you should ask that question, yourself, not me! 

**Finally**, will I update you regularly on my portfolio? Well, yes. But given these are companies I want to own for many years, I hope there aren't going to be a lot changes!
