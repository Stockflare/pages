Every finance site looks the same. Data, charts, news feeds, adverts from online brokers. It's noisy, overloading and discouraging. Especially to a novice. People give up.

So when we came to designing Stockflare we had one over arching goal, simplicity. 

Why? If we couldn't make financial data simple, it wouldn't be accessible to the novice.

How did we do it? Well scoot on over to our [Behance Presentation](https://www.behance.net/gallery/19808457/Stockflare-Find-New-Ideas) and you'll see.
