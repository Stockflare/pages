From [Oscar Wilde](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Wilde), playwright and poet, general wit.

"Experience is simply the name we give our mistakes."

Investing is like many things in life, you can't really learn it by reading. Need to act, even if some of the results are painful.

Do you have a favourite quote from a famous investor or stock market pundit? We'd love to hear it.
