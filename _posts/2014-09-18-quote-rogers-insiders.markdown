From [Jim Rogers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Rogers), co-founder of the Quantum Fund with George Soros. This is a quote from the book [Clash of the Financial Pundits](http://www.amazon.com/Clash-Financial-Pundits-Influences-Investment/dp/0071817921).

"Gosh, I used to get insider information all the time, but then I realised most of it was wrong!"

There is so much noise in the financial markets and on the news. Should you take someone else's opinion, or just have your own?

Do you have a favourite quote from a famous investor or stock market pundit? We'd love to hear it.
