From [Howard Marks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Marks_%28investor%29), co-founder of [Oaktree Capital](http://www.oaktreecapital.com/) and author of [The Most Important Thing: Uncommon Sense for the Thoughtful Investor](http://www.amazon.com/The-Most-Important-Thing-Thoughtful/dp/0231153686).

> You can't predict, you can prepare.

Marks [wrote in 2001](http://www.oaktreecapital.com/MemoTree/2001_11_20%20You%20Can%27t%20Predict.pdf) about the difficulty of predicting the future. Instead of trying to predict the future, he argues that it's better to think about where we are in the bull / bear market cycle. And prepare accordingly. Do you know where we are in this bull market?
