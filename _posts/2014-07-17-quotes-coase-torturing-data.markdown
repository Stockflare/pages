From a Nobel prize winning economist, [Ronald Coase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Coase).

"If you torture the data long enough, it will confess to anything".

Well? Shouldn't we trust our intuition when investing in stocks? Not just run analysis after analysis?

Do you have a favourite quote from a famous investor or stock market pundit? We'd love to hear it.
