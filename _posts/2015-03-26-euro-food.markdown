Living in the UK, but coming from euroland, it would be odd if I wasn't interested in companies across the channel. Sure there are two thousand stocks in the UK to choose from with 400 worth more than a billion dollars. But euroland is 50% bigger with over 3,000 stocks and 600 large businesses to choose from. And wow are there lots of amazing businesses for a stock picker to consider.

## Why the dogfood?

It's a funny phrase [dogfooding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food). Though like many stock pickers, I love sharing my ideas. Why? If I've bought something silly, I hope you'll point it out. So, I'm going to list the European stocks that I own. 

Though don't get carried away. At Stockflare we don't give advice, make recommendations or predictions. As Sam Goldwyn the founder of MGM Studios said:

> Never make predictions, especially about the future.

Remember if you are picking stocks for yourself, the only person who can advise you on what's right, is *you*. 

## So what have I got?

I've 21 companies in my euro portfolio. If the stockbrokers have got their analysis right and the companies perform as expected, my €26,000 ($29k) could grow 15% per annum to €71,000 ($78k) in seven years. That would be an amazing performance, and no doubt it'll be a volatile ride, like every stock market is.

Let's look at a few of the names on the list, and remember, I'm a value guy, who hates buying businesses that are in the lime light. My preference is to find forgotten companies with good businesses and nice long term growth prospects.

 Europe is awash with the most amazing engineers and technologists. Look at [Dr. Hoenle](https://www.stockflare.com/#stocks/HNLG.DE) a leader in ultraviolet lights or [OHB Technology](https://www.stockflare.com/#stocks/OHBG.DE) who make components for the satellite industry. But, I've even got some pretty "boring businesses" like [Somfy](https://www.stockflare.com/#stocks/DAMA.PA) who make roller shutters and [CIE Automotive](https://www.stockflare.com/#stocks/CIEA.MC) who make car parts for pretty much every major car company in the world.

## But they aren't all 5 star stocks?

Of the 3,000 stocks that trade in euro, less than 1% are [5 star stocks](http://learn.stockflare.com/stockflare/2014/10/30/A2-what-are-five-star-stocks.html). It's a limited hunting ground. Stockflare's 5 star rating is a quality measure and *we don't do recommendations*. So you shouldn't be surprised that only 11 of my 21 stocks are 5 star. 

Here's the list of all 30 stocks in euroland with 5 stars. There are enormous companies like [Airbus](https://www.stockflare.com/#stocks/AIR.PA) and [Electricite de France](https://www.stockflare.com/stocks/EDF.PA) which I typically ignore. And there are gaming and gambling stocks like [OPAP](https://www.stockflare.com/#stocks/OPAr.AT) and [bet-at-home](https://www.stockflare.com/#stocks/ARTG.F) that make me uncomfortable.

## What's the detail?

Here's the full list of my euro stocks. Drop me a message if you want my rationale for owning any of them. I shall be happy to explain! And I promise to keep you up to date on any trades I make. Though given I look to the long-term, they'll be few and far between!
