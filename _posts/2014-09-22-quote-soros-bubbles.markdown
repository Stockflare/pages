From [George Soros](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Soros), co-founder of the Quantum Fund with Jim Rogers.

"Stock market bubbles don't grow out of thin air. They have a solid basis in reality, but reality as distorted by a misconception."

Don't fight the Fed has been a great investment strategy, but has it gone a little too far by now?
