From [Sam Goldwyn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Goldwyn), one of the most successful executives in Hollywood.

"Never make forecasts, especially about the future."

There's no data on the future, so our forecasts risk being wrong. So it's better to think about the different potential outcomes, both good ones and bad!
