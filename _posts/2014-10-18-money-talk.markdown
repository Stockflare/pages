From [Richard Armour](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Armour), poet and satirist.

Money talks I'll not deny
I hear it once: It said, "Goodbye"

If you ain't looking after your money, you can say sayonara to it. 

Do you have a favourite quote from a famous investor or stock market pundit? We'd love to hear it.
