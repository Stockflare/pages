    <h3>How to Apply</h3>
    <p>We prefer that our candidates spend their time helping to fix or improve problems in the greater open source community, rather than completing a rudimentary throw-away technical test.</p>
    <p>In-order to apply, show us how you have contributed to the open source community, or pick a frequented Ruby gem or Javascript library that you may have noticed a bug or an ongoing issue for. Then simply contribute towards a solution for the problem. Just get involved!</p>
    <p>Afterwards to get your application started, simply email your resume to us, along with a link to the issue that you contributed towards.</p>
