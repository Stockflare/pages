*Updated on January  7, 2015*

This Terms of Service & Subscriber Agreement govern your use of our website, web application, mobile application, and unless other terms and conditions expressly govern, any other electronic services from Stockflare Limited that may be made available from time to time (each, a "Service").

If you compete your registration to Stockflare you agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, you should not proceed with the registration process or immediately delete your account and inform us. To the extent you have access to, or are using, a Service without having completed our registration process, you are hereby notified that your continued use of a Service is subject to many of the terms and conditions of this Agreement as explained in Section 7 below.

---

### 1. Personal Capacity.
You agree that your access to, and use of, the Services and the content and tools available though the Services is in a personal capacity.

---

### 2. Changes to Subscriber Agreement.
We may change the terms of this Agreement at any time by notifying you of the change in writing or electronically (including without limitation, by email or by posting a notice on the Service that the terms have been "updated" or similar words including notification via a post on our blog). The changes also will appear in this document, which you can access at any time by going to the Terms of Service link at a Service. You signify that you agree to be bound by such changes by using a Service after changes are made to this Agreement.

---

### 3. Privacy and Your Account.
Registration data and other information about you are subject to our Privacy Policy. Your information may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country where Stockflare Limited has facilities, and by subscribing to a Service, you consent to the transfer of information outside of your country. If you access a Service using a password, you are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of that password. If you provide someone else with access to your password to a Service, they will have the ability to view information about your account and make changes through the website for the Service. Similarly, if you tell someone the answer to your security question for a Service, they will be able to request information about your account and make changes. You agree to notify us promptly if you change your address or email so we can continue to contact you and send any notices required hereunder. If you fail to notify us promptly of a change, then any notice we send to your old address or email shall be deemed sufficient notice.

---

### 4. Fees and Payments.
You agree to pay the subscription fees and any other charges incurred in connection with your user name and password for a Service (including any applicable taxes) at the rates in effect when the charges were incurred. If your subscription includes access to areas containing premium content or services, your access to such areas may be subject to additional fees, terms and conditions, which will be separately disclosed in such areas. We will bill all charges automatically to your credit or debit card. Subscription fees will be billed at the beginning of your subscription or any renewal. Unless we state in writing otherwise, all fees and charges are nonrefundable. We may change the fees and charges then in effect, or add new fees or charges, by giving you notice in advance. If you believe someone has accessed a Service using your user name and password without your authorization, please contact us. You are responsible for any fees or charges incurred to access a Service through an Internet access provider or other third-party service.

---

### 5. Cancellation and Renewal.
Your subscription will renew automatically, unless it is cancelled in accordance with this Section. For all subscriptions, you must cancel your subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of subscription fees for the renewal term to your credit or debit card. We may cancel your subscription at any time by notifying you.

**6.1** Downloadable Mobile Products.

**6.2** Other Subscribers and Users. If you access a Service as part of a free trial or otherwise without becoming a subscriber, you are hereby notified that all of the terms and conditions of this Subscriber Agreement except the section labeled "Fees and Payments" and "Renewal" apply to your use and access of the Service.

### 13. Cookie Disclosure Statement

**13.1** We employ cookie technology.

**13.2**. Below you'll find information describing our most common uses of cookies, which are an inherent part of our production process and have enabled us to better serve you.

**13.3** What's a cookie? A cookie is a small file that is sent to your computer by a site's server. A cookie can be a record of your visit to a site, including information such as your User Name, registration information, time of last visit, pages viewed, etc. A cookie created by one site's servers can be retrieved only by that site's servers. Thus, information in the cookies is not accessible to other sites.

**13.4** Using our Services. In order to access the Services successfully, your browser must be set to "accept all cookies." If you set your browser to "not accept" any cookies, you will not be able to use the Services.

**13.5** We also do not suggest that you navigate the Services with your browser's "cookie alert" feature enabled. While you certainly could set your browser to alert you each time a cookie is passed to your machine, you most likely will find the experience of having to respond to frequent cookie alerts quite frustrating while trying to enjoy your subscription. We suggest that you turn the "cookie alert" feature off, or perhaps use the site for a short time with it on, once you've seen firsthand how we use the technology.

**13.6** Why do we use cookies? We use cookies to allow you to move quickly through our site. We accomplish this in many ways, using several different cookies.

**13.7** Without cookie technology, we would not be able to offer you convenient features.

**13.8** Other cookies that you will receive during your sessions are from third-party service providers or third-party network advertisers. These network advertisers may use their own cookies in order to serve ads on the Services, ensuring you won't see the same ads over and over again.

**13.9** When you view an ad on other sites, our third-party advertising company may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. The Services and our third-party advertising company also may use Web beacons (invisible images often referred to as pixel tags or clear GIFs) to note which Services pages you visit after viewing our ads. The information that is collected through the use of these images is not personally identifiable and is used only to track response to our advertising efforts.

The Services do not provide tax, legal or investment advice or opinion regarding the suitability, value or profitability of any particular security, portfolio or investment strategy. Neither we nor our licensors shall be liable for any errors, inaccuracies or delays in the Services or any Content, or for any actions taken by you in reliance thereon.
