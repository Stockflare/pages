*Updated on November 1, 2013*

This Terms of Service & Subscriber Agreement govern your use of our website, web application, mobile application, and unless other terms and conditions expressly govern, any other electronic services from Instense Limited that may be made available from time to time (each, a "Service").
If you agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, you should check the box indicating your agreement to the terms of this Agreement on the registration page for the Service. If you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, you should not check the box but you will not be able to proceed with the registration process for the respective Service and become a subscriber. To the extent you have access to, or are using, a Service without having completed our registration process, you are hereby notified that your continued use of a Service is subject to many of the terms and conditions of this Agreement as explained in Section 56 below.

---

### 1. Personal Capacity.
You agree that your access to, and use of, the Services and the content and tools available though the Services is in a personal capacity.

---

### 2. Changes to Subscriber Agreement.
We may change the terms of this Agreement at any time by notifying you of the change in writing or electronically (including without limitation, by email or by posting a notice on the Service that the terms have been "updated" or similar words). The changes also will appear in this document, which you can access at any time by going to the Terms of Service link at a Service. You signify that you agree to be bound by such changes by using a Service after changes are made to this Agreement.

### 32. Privacy and Your Account.
Registration data and other information about you are subject to our Privacy Policy. Your information may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country where Instense Limited has facilities, and by subscribing to a Service, you consent to the transfer of information outside of your country. If you access a Service using a password, you are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of that password. If you provide someone else with access to your password to a Service, they will have the ability to view information about your account and make changes through the website for the Service. Similarly, if you tell someone the answer to your security question for a Service, they will be able to request information about your account and make changes. You agree to notify us promptly if you change your address or email so we can continue to contact you and send any notices required hereunder. If you fail to notify us promptly of a change, then any notice we send to your old address or email shall be deemed sufficient notice.

---

### 43. Fees and Payments.
You agree to pay the subscription fees and any other charges incurred in connection with your user name and password for a Service (including any applicable taxes) at the rates in effect when the charges were incurred. If your subscription includes access to areas containing premium content or services, your access to such areas may be subject to additional fees, terms and conditions, which will be separately disclosed in such areas. We will bill all charges automatically to your credit or debit card. Subscription fees will be billed at the beginning of your subscription or any renewal. Unless we state in writing otherwise, all fees and charges are nonrefundable. We may change the fees and charges then in effect, or add new fees or charges, by giving you notice in advance. If you believe someone has accessed a Service using your user name and password without your authorization, please contact us. You are responsible for any fees or charges incurred to access a Service through an Internet access provider or other third-party service.

---

### 54. Cancellation and Renewal.
Your subscription will renew automatically, unless it is cancelled in accordance with this Section. For all subscriptions, you must cancel your subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of subscription fees for the renewal term to your credit or debit card. We may cancel your subscription at any time by notifying you.

**65.2** Other Subscribers and Users.

**110.1** The parties acknowledge that any statutory or common law claims related to intellectual property may require forms of equitable relief that are best administered by courts; accordingly, the parties agree that except for statutory or common law claims related to intellectual property and disputes that qualify for small claims court, any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, will be resolved by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction located in the County of New York in the State of New York shall constitute a court of competent jurisdiction. For more information about arbitration, the AAA and the arbitration process, please consult the American Arbitration Association web site, You agree that by entering into this Agreement, you and we are each waiving the right to trial by jury, except as otherwise stated above. Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted and, by entering into this Agreement, you are giving up the ability to participate in a class action. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope, application, and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for the court to decide. As stated in Section 11 below, New York law applies to any arbitration under this section, but the parties acknowledge that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This agreement to arbitrate shall survive termination of this Agreement. This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and, if the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you.

**110.3** The arbitrator may award money or equitable relief in favor of only the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. To reduce the time and expense of the arbitration, the arbitrator will not provide a statement of reasons for his or her award unless requested to do so by both parties. Unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

While you certainly could set your browser to alert you each time a cookie is passed to your machine, you most likely will find the experience of having to respond to frequent cookie alerts quite frustrating while trying to enjoy your subscription. We suggest that you turn the "cookie alert" feature off, or perhaps use the site for a short time with it on, once you've seen firsthand how we use the technology.

**132.6** Why do we use cookies? We use cookies to allow you to move quickly through our site. We accomplish this in many ways, using several different cookies.

**132.7** Without cookie technology, we would not be able to offer you convenient features.

**132.8** When you view an ad on other sites, our third-party advertising company may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. The Services and our third-party advertising company also may use Web beacons (invisible images often referred to as pixel tags or clear GIFs) to note which Services pages you visit after viewing our ads.
