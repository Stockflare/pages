| Who we are        | What we do           | Why we do it  |
|:------------- |:-------------|:------|
| Young and old. Techie and financial. Professional & consumer. We are a team with a wide range of experience, condensed into one goal: making investing simple. Based in London, our view of the world and finance is global. We canâ€™t afford to be any other way. | We want to help anyone improve their financial performance. How? By giving you the tools to make better investment decisions. We cut away the complexity and noise that Wall Street masks itself with. So anyone can clearly and quickly get to the right answer on any stock. | Like you, we are frustrated by the way we save and invest today. We want everyone to realise, they can manage their own money better than leaving it to Wall Street. We want people to discover great new companies and start enjoying how they save and invest.
