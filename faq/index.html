<a class="faq-anchor" name="5-star-stock"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin">What's a 5 star stock?</h3>

<p>It's a way to judge the quality of a stock and see where the risks are. It is neither a recommendation nor an endorsement.</p>

<p>There are so many different ways to judge a stock. But with our 5 star rating, you can quickly analysis 5 key metrics.</p>

<p>So a 5 star stock, is one that passes all 5 quality tests. The first test look at whether a company is profitable or not. Clearly, profitable businesses are less risky. The second test, checks if a stock pays dividends. Businesses that pay dividends are higher quality that businesses that don't, other things being equal. The third test looks at the long-term and short-term growth forecasts for a business. Obviously, a business that is growing is better than one that isn't. Fourthly, we look at the valuation of the stock, using the price-to-earnings ratio. In this case, a lower/ cheaper valuation is less risky that a higher valuation, other things being equal. And with the fifth and final metric, we look at the opinion and recommendation of the stock brokers. We get the average recommendation of all stock brokers. They rate some stocks a Buy, some a Sell. They forecast price targets that are sometimes higher, sometimes lower than the current price. So a business which the experts on "Wall Street" think is a Buy with a target price that is above the current share price is likely to be better quality than a business that is rated a Sell with a lower price target.</p>

<p>Using these 5 filters helps identify the relative strengths of one stock versus another. You can use these filters to see where the risks are behind a stock.</p>

<p>But please, don't make a leap, and assume that a 5 star stock is a better investment than a zero star stock. In every walk of life quality and price diverge. High quality products can be over priced. Low quality products are sometimes selling at bargain prices. It's the same for stocks. </p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="what-are-filters"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> What are filters?</h3>

<p>Filters help you find your favourite stocks.</p>

<p>Our "Pick Stocks" feature is a classic stock screener. Anyone can run their own analysis to find their own stock ideas.</p>

<p>You can choose the country you live in, a sector you like, then think about the type of company you like. Filter to get results. And re-filter to hone your choices.</p>

<p>You've a lot of control on the way you cut and re-cut the information. You can select different countries, currencies, sectors, industries, different ways to value businesses, and look at whether the companies are loved or hated by Wall Street.</p>

<p>Imagine, there are over 47,000 publicly listed stocks in our database. (No private companies, only listed stocks). We get data on almost every stock market in the world from Thomson Reuters. (That's all stock exchanges bar Iran, at the moment.) We then take this data, exclude any duplicates or stocks where Thomson Reuters has no financial data or estimates from stock brokers, and load the information into our database. As a result, Stockflare is probably the most comprehensive, objective database of all the stock markets in the world, that is freely accessible on the web.</p>
</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="can-i-trade"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> Can I buy shares via Stockflare?</h3>

<p>No.</p>

<p>We are an information business. We crunch through large quantities of financial data and present the analysis in a simple and useful manner.</p>

<p>We don’t look after your money or offer trading. There are countless people who do. In fact, many of our users have their money with a stockbroker already.</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="how-do-i-trade"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> How do I buy shares?</h3>

<p>Get a trading account.</p>

<p>If you are new to the stock market, you’ll need to get yourself a trading account. A quick Google search will yield lots of options.</p>

<p>We use “discount online brokers”. They are firms that charge small flat fees per trade. They don’t give you advice or research or a personalised service. Nor do they charge high-fees or take a fixed percentage of your money every year. Imagine paying 2% a year to someone to manage your money. 10 years later they’ve got 20% of your money!</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="can-i-trade-for-free"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> I can trade shares for free, right?</h3>

<p>Beware!</p>

<p>There are now several firms that offer “free” online trading. What they mean is you pay zero-commission to do the trade. Or they offer you a bizarre “contracts-for-difference” investment, where you don’t actually buy the shares at all, but buy a derivative.</p>

<p>Remember the adage: “If you aren’t paying for a product, you are the product”.</p>

<p>Many of the “free” online traders make money, by selling your trades to the vultures on “Wall Street”. That’s because the High Frequency Traders want to see what you are doing, trade ahead of you, or worse trade against you.</p>

<p>So, if you think “free” is a good deal, remember, there is a reason it's "free".</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="is-investing-risky"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> Is investing in shares risky?</h3>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>It’s very risky. You can lose all your money. Yes, all, if the value of the company you’ve invested in plummets.</p>

<p>Or worse, you could speculate, borrowing money to invest in shares and then lose even more money that the cash you invested. That’s called investing on margin.</p>

<p>Brokers love lending you money to trade. Fees, fees, fees. Even though they could bankrupt you.</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="how-do-i-mitigate-risks"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> So how do I mitigate the risks?</h3>

<p>Don’t be stupid!</p>

<p>Invest in what you know. Don’t buy things you don’t understand. Don’t borrow to invest, as that’s speculating, not investing.</p>

<p>If there’s nothing you like out there, just do nothing. No one lost money sitting on their cash.</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="professional-trust"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> Shouldn’t I trust the professionals with my money?</h3>

<p>That’s entirely your call.</p>

<p>If you think someone else cares about your finances more that you do, then fire away.</p>

<p>But remember investing is the only “game” where the amateur beats the professional every time. Even on an off day, Tiger Woods will beat you on the golf course. Serena Williams would whip any of us at tennis, male or female. But in investing, amateurs typically outperform professionals.</p>

<p>The quantity of academic research that confirms this is scary. Or at least, given the facts, the $200+ billion in fees we pay investment managers a year is scary. Think of it, the professionals underperform the market, and the market underperforms a randomly selected portfolio.</p>

<p>But maybe your retirement isn’t that important to you. So why not call a broker. Let him enjoy looking after your money for you.</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="providing-advice"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> Are you giving me advice?</h3>

<p>We don’t give advice, we don't recommend.</p>

<p>Just like Yahoo! Finance, Google Finance, Reuters.com, Motley Fool, and other similar sites, we don’t tell you what to buy, what to sell. We don’t make recommendations.</p>

<p>We focus on the objective data, which we buy from Thomson Reuters. We give you access to all the key metrics behind every publicly traded stock in the world. With this analysis, you can do a lot of research. We avoid subjective data and opinion. For example, we don't provide research reports from stock brokers, we don't provide news and reporting.</p>

<p>You will see the phrases “Buy”, “Strong Buy”, “Sell”, “Strong Sell” and price targets for stocks. These are all from the Wall Street consensus. They are not the views of Stockflare, or our main data provider, Thomson Reuters.</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="wall-street-recommendation"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> What's a "Wall Street" consensus recommendation?</h3>

<p>It’s an average.</p>

<p>There are tens of stockbrokers writing research on every single company. These professionals talk to the management teams, talk to the big shareholders, analyse the competitors and the market. Then they write reports on the health of the companies and recommend to clients if they should “Buy” or “Sell” the shares.</p>

<p>But like economists, stockbrokers rarely agree. Some think a stock is going up, others think it is going down. They’ll even tell you the stock will go nowhere. They call that a “Hold”.</p>

<p>To cut through the disagreement, the big financial data companies, Thomson Reuters, Bloomberg, Factset, S&P Capital IQ, publish what they call the “consensus”. Bit of a misnomer given there is rarely a consensus.</p>

<p>In fact, this is the average of all the forecasts and views of the stockbrokers, for that particular stock. Just like the “wisdom-of-the-crowd” shows, the average is typically a better, more consistent forecaster, than hanging your hat on the views of any 1 stockbroker.</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="what-is-wall-street"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> Why do you keep talking about “Wall Street”?</h3>

<p>“Wall Street” isn’t just a place, it’s a state of mind!</p>

<p>We use the phrase Wall Street to collectively talk about the views of the professionals. The stockbrokers, investment bankers, investment managers, hedge funds, private bankers and other people who make their money off investing.</p>

<p>These are the highly paid folks, who in aggregate can’t beat the stock market. Not a surprise, given they are the market. But what is a surprise is that so many of them actually underperform the market. Though that’s after they’ve taken their juicy fees.</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="if-i-lose-money"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> If I lose money who’s fault is it?</h3>

<p>It’s your fault.</p>

<p>You are in control of your financial destiny. You decide. You research. You check. You discuss ideas with the people you trust. You make the decisions.</p>

<p>If you want to be spoon feed, or have someone to blame, get yourself an expensive financial advisor. But even then, it’s still your fault, since you chose the wrong advisor. Regardless, you’ll have lost money. Which is breaking one of the golden rules of good investing.</p>

<p>Stockflare is here to give everyone access to large quantities of financial data, objective analysis in a easy-to-understand and easy-to-use manner. We are not a "free" provider of investment research. Our users have to do their research, and make their decisions themselves. And we believe that everyone has the skill to manage their investments, when they try!</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="data-source"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> Where does your raw data come from?</h3>

<p>Thomson Reuters, mainly.</p>

<p>We buy the core of our financial data from Thomson Reuters. They are one of the leading professional information companies in the world. Their financial data is used at thousands of “Wall Street” firms with hundreds of thousands of professionals relying on their data and services to make their investment decisions.</p>

<p>All the major websites like Google Finance, Yahoo! Finance, CNBC, etc buy data from Thomson Reuters. So you may not realise it, but you are already a customer of theirs, indirectly at the least.</p>

<p>We run a lot of analysis on the data and present it in a way that anyone can understand, quickly</p>

<p>In addition to Thomson Reuters we use the exchange rate data from OpenExchangeRate.org so we can make like for like comparisions across markets.</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="crowd-wisdom"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> What’s the Wisdom of the Crowd?</h3>

<p>Together, we are as smart as any professional.</p>

<p>When you ask a large enough sample of random people a question, regardless of their expertise, they are pretty good at getting to the right answer. It’s an experiment that’s been tried multiple times.</p>

<p>So? Well, Stockflare’s a crowd. You may not realise it, but the aggregate view of everyone that uses Stockflare is really insightful. This is data, we plan to give to use our users. Not to sell it to hedge funds or other vultures, so they can take advantage of you.</p>

<p>In the near future, we are going to ask our users if that are willing to share their data with the "Stockflare crowd" in an aggregated and anonymous manner. That way, we can give users an insight into what their investments look like versus the Stockflare crowd.</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="real-time-data"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> Why is the data not real-time?</h3>

<p>It’s expensive for a startup.</p>

<p>Sorry. That’s the honest truth. We’ll have real-time pricing as soon we can afford it.</p>

<p>But real-time is relative. Who’s real-time? Large stocks like Apple or Wal-mart trade on over 12 different stock exchanges. So which price is the right one? And even if you know the price, by the time you’ve logged into your account, and done your trade, what’s the price you trade at? Even the professionals don’t really use real-time prices. Their computer algorithms do. So unless you are a computer and paying millions to directly connect to the stock exchanges, you should treat all suggestions of real-time with skepticism.</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="delayed-data"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> Why isn’t the data with a 15 minute delay?</h3>

<p>Yes, even delayed data is expensive.</p>

<p>Delayed data is complicated too. With every stock exchange requiring a licensing fee to display the numbers. We’ll have these sorted out as soon as practical.</p>

<p>Again, we are a startup. Sorry. </p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="out-of-date-analysis"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> So some of your analysis is out of date then?</h3>

<p>Between trading hours, yes.</p>

<p>We get end-of-day data from Thomson Reuters, at the moment.</p>

<p>Any of our data that uses a price is out of date, when the stock market is trading. For example, a PE ratio, calculated by dividing the price by the earnings figure, would be out of date. If a stock is up 2%, we’ll not have updated the PE ratio from 10.0x earnings to 10.2x.</p>

<p>Other data points like: does it pay a dividend; what’s its earnings; does Wall Street like the stock; these, all remain the same. They have nothing to do with the price of the stock.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a new idea, at the weekend, before the market opens, or when you are on the way home at night, you’ll be seeing the latest information.</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="everyone-out-of-date"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> Is everyone else’s analysis out of date too?</h3>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Have you ever come across a large database where 100.00000% of the data is right? Even Google will occasionally give you the wrong telephone number or directions.</p>

<p>We’ve spotted problems on all our competitors websites. We’ve found major errors in the large professional data providers databases too. Some of those errors then don’t get picked up by the large financial websites. They just take the raw data as it is, and push it to their users, errors and all.</p>

<p>Remember, computers and humans are involved. Its a lethal combination for accuracy.</p>

<p>So be vigilant. If you see a number that doesn’t look right. It probably isn’t.</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="are-some-numbers-wrong"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> Are some of your numbers wrong?</h3>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Like any big data company, we’ll have errors. So please let us know if you spot one. Or if you have the faintest doubt about any information at Stockflare, tell us.</p>

<p>We try our best, with automated checks, random sampling of the data, and audits. But we won’t catch everything. So please help us. We really appreciate the community spirit.</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="what-is-a-watch-list"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> What is a watch list?</h3>

<p>It’s your favourites.</p>

<p>Stockflare isn’t just a way for you to search for new ideas, stocks you’ve not thought of before. The “unknown unknowns” as Donald Rumsfeld would say.</p>

<p>We also want you to keep track of the companies you know and the companies you already own. That’s what a watch list is for. You can add companies to it, and then look at our analysis of your favourite companies, side-by-side. We’ll even tell you if Wall Street hates any of the companies you add to the watch list.</p>

<p>By the way, you’ll need to register to have a watchlist.</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="registration-benefits"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> What is the benefit of registering?</h3>

<p>Save your ideas.</p>

<p>For example, watch lists. If you want us to track a list of companies for you, then we’d like to know who you are. That way, you can come back anytime on any device and see our analysis of the stocks you care about most.</p>

<p>Similarly, if you access Stockflare from multiple devices, you’ll need to register if you want to access the same profile across your devices.</p>

<p>Plus there’s that little chestnut, privacy. Better to put sensitive data behind a password, eh?</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="connect-portfolio"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> Can I connect my real portfolio to Stockflare?</h3>

<p>No. At least, not yet.</p>

<p>Today you can input the stocks you own and how many shares you own in each of them. That way we can calculate the value of your stock portfolio.</p>

<p>In the future, we’ll give you the option to directly connect to your brokerage account. When we get there, we’ll update your portfolio’s stocks, size and value, every night.</p>

<p>But until then, sorry.</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="company-peers"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> How do you decide who are a company's competitors?</h3>

<p>It’s not a science, sadly.</p>

<p>Thomson Reuters have an extensive database that divides and sub-divides all the stocks in the world into 10 sectors, that divide into 25 business sectors, that divide into 52 industry groups, that divide into 124 industries, that divide into 837 activites.</p>

<p> We take "activity" for a stock, and check if there are at least 10 competitors in the same activity in the same region. If there is, then we use this to calculate the peer average. But if there aren't at least 10 competitors, we then, move up tot he "industies" level to see if there are a sufficient number of competitors to calculate an average.</p>

<p>But if there aren't at least 10 competitors, we then, move up to the "industies" level to see if there are a sufficient number of competitors to calculate an average.</p>

<p>We repeat the checks, to see if there is sufficent data at this level, and if not we move to the "industry groups" level.</p>

<p>Our goal is to algorithmically generate a peer list, that is objective and robust. Though please note,  we plan to let our users edit the analysis themselves, inside their own profile, in the future, just in case you don't agree with the peer lists generated using Thomson Reuters classifications.</p>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> Who is Stockflare?</h3>

<p>4 folks in the UK.</p>

<p>We are a London based startup. A team of 4 with experience in finance, technology, and consumer businesses. We own the company too.</p>

<p>We need Stockflare ourselves, to help us find new ideas. We share the same pain as everyone else. That’s what we are here to fix.</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="stockflare-independent"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> Is Stockflare independent?</h3>

<p>Yes. We’ve no axe to grind.</p>

<p>We aren’t a stockbroker who want’s you to trade more and more. We aren’t an investment bank who doesn’t tell you what they really think about a stock for fear of offending the company’s CEO. We aren’t an investment manager, taking a percentage of your money in fees, regardless of how good or bad we are. We aren’t selling your data to some vulture fund, so they can trade against you.</p>

<p>We strive to be independent and unbiased. We need to earn your trust. And to do that, we have to prove to you that the information we give you is of the highest quality and not tainted by some ulterior motive.</p>

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> How does Stockflare make money?</h3>

<p>Sadly we don’t.</p>

<p>At least not yet. Again, it’s one of those horrible problems of being a startup.</p>

<p>Once we’ve got to a sufficient size, we’ll start making money. But for now, we are investing our own money, every day, in building and running Stockflare.</p>

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> You say investing is simple. Is it?</h3>

<p>Yes, if you try.</p>

<p>As both Warren Buffett and Richard Oldfield are reported to have said. “Investing is simple, but not easy”. The main problem is ourselves. We get over excited, too confident, sloppy. When that happens we make mistakes.</p>

<p>One of the biggest mistakes is to rely on the recommendations and advice of others. The talking heads on financial television, the research reports of investment banks, the tips you read in a newspaper. Please, do the research. Talk to the people you trust. Work out what investments are right you.</p>

<p>For us, there are two golden rules to successful investing. Don’t lose what you’ve got. And grow it.</p>

<p>Simple as it sounds, they aren’t easy to stick to. If all your friends are piling into hot stocks or junk bonds, it’s difficult to resist. But trust your instincts and you’ll be fine.</p>

<p>Just remember what Fidelity Investments most successful fund manager, Peter Lynch recommends, “Know what you own, know why you own it… and never invest in a stock you can’t explain with a crayon”!</p>
