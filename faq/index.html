<a class="faq-anchor" name="5-star-stock"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin">What's a 5 star stock?</h3>

<p>They are our favourite stocks.</p>

<p>There are so many different ways to judge a stock. But at Stockflare, we love 5 numbers. These are tests, we value highly.</p>

<p>So a 5 star stock, is one that passes all 5 tests. We love companies that are profitable, pay some of those profits via dividends, are growing their profits strongly, look like they are cheap versus the competitors, and are companies that Wall Street believes have good potential.</p>

<p>Using these 5 filters, helps us identify the sort of companies we like. But we know that you may look at the world a different way. So please test out our Filters on the home page to zoom in on the type of companies you like.</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="what-are-filters"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> What are filters?</h3>

<p>Filters help you find your favourite stocks.</p>

<p>We use filters to calculate what we think are 5-star stocks. But anyone can run their own analysis to find their own stock ideas. In fact, that’s the whole aim of Stockflare.</p>

<p>At our homepage, choose the country you live in, a sector you like, then think about the type of company you like. Filter to get results. And re-filter to hone your choices.</p>

<p>You've a lot of control on the way you cut and re-cut the information. You can select different countries, currencies, sectors, industries, different ways to value businesses, and look at whether the companies are loved or hated by Wall Street.</p>

<p>Give it a whirl and if you find a real gem that’s not a 5-star stock as we see it, please drop us a note. We love hearing great ideas.</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="can-i-trade"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> Can I buy shares via Stockflare?</h3>

<p>No.</p>

<p>We are an information business. We crunch through large quantities of financial data and present the analysis in a simple and useful manner.</p>

<p>We don’t look after your money or offer trading. There are countless people who do. In fact, many of our users have their money with a stockbroker already.</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="how-do-i-trade"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> How do I buy shares?</h3>

<p>Get a trading account.</p>

<p>If you are new to the stock market, you’ll need to get yourself a trading account. A quick Google search will yield lots of options.</p>

<p>We use “discount online brokers”. They are firms that charge small flat fees per trade. They don’t give you advice or research or a personalised service. Nor do they charge high-fees or take a fixed percentage of your money every year. Imagine paying 2% a year to someone to manage your money. 10 years later they’ve got 20% of your money!</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="can-i-trade-for-free"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> I can trade shares for free, right?</h3>

<p>Beware!</p>

<p>There are now several firms that offer “free” online trading. What they mean is you pay zero-commission to do the trade. Or they offer you a bizarre “contracts-for-difference” investment, where you don’t actually buy the shares at all, but buy a derivative.</p>

<p>Remember the adage: “If you aren’t paying for a product, you are the product”.</p>

<p>Many of the “free” online traders make money, by selling your trades to the vultures on “Wall Street”. That’s because the High Frequency Traders want to see what you are doing, trade ahead of you, or worse trade against you.</p>

<p>So, if you think “free” is a good deal, think again.</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="is-investing-risky"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> Is investing in shares risky?</h3>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>It’s very risky. You can lose all your money. Yes, all, if the value of the company you’ve invested in plummets.</p>

<p>Or worse, you could speculate, borrowing money to invest in shares and then lose even more money that the cash you invested. That’s called investing on margin.</p>

<p>Brokers love lending you money to trade. Fees, fees, fees. Even though they could bankrupt you.</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="how-do-i-mitigate-risks"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> So how do I mitigate the risks?</h3>

<p>Don’t be stupid!</p>

<p>Invest in what you know. Don’t buy things you don’t understand. Don’t borrow to invest, as that’s speculating, not investing.</p>

<p>If there’s nothing you like out there, just do nothing. No one lost money sitting on their cash.</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="professional-trust"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> Shouldn’t I trust the professionals with my money?</h3>

<p>That’s entirely your call.</p>

<p>If you think someone else cares about your finances more that you do, then fire away.</p>

<p>But remember investing is the only “game” where the amateur beats the professional every time. Even on an off day, Tiger Woods will beat you on the golf course. Serena Williams would whip any of us at tennis, male or female. But in investing, amateurs typically outperform professionals.</p>

<p>The quantity of academic research that confirms this is scary. Or at least, given the facts, the $200+ billion in fees we pay investment managers a year is scary. Think of it, the professionals underperform the market, and the market underperforms a randomly selected portfolio.</p>

<p>But maybe your retirement isn’t that important to you. So why not call a broker. Let him enjoy looking after your money for you.</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="providing-advice"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> Are you giving me advice?</h3>

<p>We don’t give advice.</p>

<p>Just like Yahoo! Finance, Google Finance, Reuters.com, Motley Fool, and other similar sites, we don’t tell you what to buy, what to sell. We don’t make recommendations.</p>

<p>You will see the phrases “Buy”, “Strong Buy”, “Sell”, “Strong Sell” and price targets for stocks. These are all from the Wall Street consensus. They are not the views of Stockflare, or our main data provider, Thomson Reuters.</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="wall-street-recommendation"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> What's a "Wall Street" consensus recommendation?</h3>

<p>It’s an average.</p>

<p>There are tens of stockbrokers writing research on every single company. These professionals talk to the management teams, talk to the big shareholders, analyse the competitors and the market. Then they write reports on the health of the companies and recommend to clients if they should “Buy” or “Sell” the shares.</p>

<p>But like economists, stockbrokers rarely agree. Some think a stock is going up, others think it is going down. They’ll even tell you the stock will go nowhere. They call that a “Hold”.</p>

<p>To cut through the disagreement, the big financial data companies, Thomson Reuters, Bloomberg, Factset, S&P Capital IQ, publish what they call the “consensus”. Bit of a misnomer given there is rarely a consensus.</p>

<p>In fact, this is the average of all the forecasts and views of the stockbrokers, for that particular stock. Just like the “wisdom-of-the-crowd” shows, the average is typically a better, more consistent forecaster, than hanging your hat on the views of any 1 stockbroker.</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="what-is-wall-street"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> Why do you keep talking about “Wall Street”?</h3>

<p>“Wall Street” isn’t just a place, it’s a state of mind!</p>

<p>We use the phrase Wall Street to collectively talk about the views of the professionals. The stockbrokers, investment bankers, investment managers, hedge funds, private bankers and other people who make their money off investing.</p>

<p>These are the highly paid folks, who in aggregate can’t beat the stock market. Not a surprise, given they are the market. But what is a surprise is that so many of them actually underperform the market. Though that’s after they’ve taken their juicy fees.</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="if-i-lose-money"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> If I lose money who’s fault is it?</h3>

<p>It’s your fault.</p>

<p>You are in control of your financial destiny. You decide. You research. You check. You discuss ideas with the people you trust. You make the decisions.</p>

<p>If you want to be spoon feed, or have someone to blame, get yourself an expensive financial advisor. But even then, it’s still your fault, since you chose the wrong advisor.</p>

<p>Regardless, you’ll have lost money. Which is breaking one of the golden rules of good investing.</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="data-source"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> Where does your raw data come from?</h3>

<p>Thomson Reuters, mainly.</p>

<p>We buy the core of our financial data from Thomson Reuters. They are one of the leading professional information companies in the world. Their financial data is used at thousands of “Wall Street” firms with hundreds of thousands of professionals relying on their data and services to make their investment decisions.</p>

<p>All the major websites like Google Finance, Yahoo! Finance, CNBC, etc buy data from Thomson Reuters. So you may not realise it, but you are already a customer of theirs, indirectly at the least.</p>

<p>But we aren’t presenting you the raw data of Thomson Reuters. What would be the point of that? You’d be better off hanging out at their website, reuters.com, if that’s what you want.</p>

<p>We run a lot of analysis on the data, crunching through the key data points, making new calculations and presenting the data in a way that anyone can understand, quickly.</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="crowd-wisdom"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> What’s the Wisdom of the Crowd?</h3>

<p>Together, we are as smart as any professional.</p>

<p>When you ask a large enough sample of random people a question, regardless of their expertise, they are pretty good at getting to the right answer. It’s an experiment that’s been tried multiple times.</p>

<p>So? Well, Stockflare’s a crowd. You may not realise it, but the aggregate view of everyone that uses Stockflare is really insightful. This is data, we plan to give to use our users. Not to sell it to hedge funds or other vultures, so they can take advantage of you.</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="real-time-data"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> Why is the data not real-time?</h3>

<p>It’s expensive for a startup.</p>

<p>Sorry. That’s the honest truth. We’ll have real-time pricing as soon we can afford it.</p>

<p>But real-time is relative. Who’s real-time? Large stocks like Apple or Wal-mart trade on over 12 different stock exchanges. So which price is the right one? And even if you know the price, by the time you’ve logged into your account, and done your trade, what’s the price you trade at? Even the professionals don’t really use real-time prices. Their computer algorithms do. So unless you are a computer and paying millions to directly connect to the stock exchanges, you should treat all suggestions of real-time with skepticism.</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="delayed-data"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> Why isn’t the data with a 15 minute delay?</h3>

<p>Yes, even delayed data is expensive.</p>

<p>Delayed data is complicated too. With every stock exchange requiring a licensing fee to display the numbers. We’ll have these sorted out as soon as practical.</p>

<p>Again, we are a startup. Sorry.</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="out-of-date-analysis"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> So some of your analysis is out of date then?</h3>

<p>Between trading hours, yes.</p>

<p>Any of our data that uses a price is out of date, when the stock market is trading. For example, a PE ratio, calculated by dividing the price by the earnings figure, would be out of date. If a stock is up 2%, we’ll not have updated the PE ratio from 10.0x earnings to 10.2x.</p>

<p>Other data points like: does it pay a dividend; what’s its earnings; does Wall Street like the stock; these, all remain the same. They have nothing to do with the price of the stock.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a new idea, at the weekend, before the market opens, or when you are on the way home at night, you’ll be seeing the latest information.</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="everyone-out-of-date"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> Is everyone else’s analysis out of date too?</h3>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Have you ever come across a large database where 100.00000% of the data is right? Even Google will occasionally give you the wrong telephone number or directions.</p>

<p>We’ve spotted problems on all our competitors websites. We’ve found major errors in the large professional data providers databases too. Some of those errors then don’t get picked up by the large financial websites. They just take the raw data as it is, and push it to their users, errors and all.</p>

<p>Remember, computers and humans are involved. Its a lethal combination for accuracy.</p>

<p>So be vigilant. If you see a number that doesn’t look right. It probably isn’t.</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="are-some-numbers-wrong"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> Are some of your numbers wrong?</h3>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Like any big data company, we’ll have errors. So please let us know if you spot one. Or if you have the faintest doubt about any information at Stockflare, tell us.</p>

<p>We try our best, with automated checks, random sampling of the data, and audits. But we won’t catch everything. So please help us. We really appreciate the community spirit.</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="what-is-a-watch-list"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> What is a watch list?</h3>

<p>It’s your favourites.</p>

<p>Stockflare isn’t just a way for you to search for new ideas, stocks you’ve not thought of before. The “unknown unknowns” as Donald Rumsfeld would say.</p>

<p>We also want you to keep track of the companies you know and the companies you already own. That’s what a watch list is for. You can add companies to it, and then look at our analysis of your favourite companies, side-by-side. We’ll even tell you if Wall Street hates any of the companies you add to the watch list.</p>

<p>By the way, you’ll need to register to have a watchlist.</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="registration-benefits"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> What is the benefit of registering?</h3>

<p>Save your ideas.</p>

<p>For example, watch lists. If you want us to track a list of companies for you, then we’d like to know who you are. That way, you can come back anytime on any device and see our analysis of the stocks you care about most.</p>

<p>Similarly, if you access Stockflare from multiple devices, you’ll need to register if you want to access the same profile across your devices.</p>

<p>Plus there’s that little chestnut, privacy. Better to put sensitive data behind a password, eh?</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="connect-portfolio"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> Can I connect my real portfolio to Stockflare?</h3>

<p>No. At least, not yet.</p>

<p>Today you can input the stocks you own and how many shares you own in each of them. That way we can calculate the value of your stock portfolio.</p>

<p>In the future, we’ll give you the option to directly connect to your brokerage account. When we get there, we’ll update your portfolio’s stocks, size and value, every night.</p>

<p>But until then, sorry.</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="company-peers"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> How do you decide who are a company's competitors?</h3>

<p>It’s not a science, sadly.</p>

<p>We take the sector and industry tags that Thomson Reuters gives us, we then look at the list of peers, and adjust it. We have to balance the list between having too narrow a sample to make any comparisons and too broad a competitor list to be relevant.</p>

<p>Today, we look at in-country competitors only. Yes Samsung is a competitor of Apple, but it’s in South Korea, and a US investor is highly unlikely to want to or be able to buy stocks on the Korea Exchange.</p>

<p>Sometimes, there aren’t any competitors to the stock you are looking at. That’s because there just aren’t any local competitors. It usually happens in small countries. In this case, we look at how attractive the stock is relative to all the other stocks on the same stock exchange. This means we are comparing telephone companies to supermarkets.  It’s not ideal, but if you are only interested in investing in stocks on your local market, then its a valid comparison.</p>

<p>If you’d like to make your own competitor lists and store them at Stockflare, please let us know.</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="who-is-stockflare"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> Who is Stockflare?</h3>

<p>4 folks in the UK.</p>

<p>We are a London based startup. A team of 4 with experience in finance, technology, and consumer businesses. We own the company too.</p>

<p>We need Stockflare ourselves, to help us find new ideas. We share the same pain as everyone else. That’s what we are here to fix.</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="stockflare-independent"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> Is Stockflare independent?</h3>

<p>Yes. We’ve no axe to grind.</p>

<p>We aren’t a stockbroker who want’s you to trade more and more. We aren’t an investment bank who doesn’t tell you what they really think about a stock for fear of offending the company’s CEO. We aren’t an investment manager, taking a percentage of your money in fees, regardless of how good or bad we are. We aren’t selling your data to some vulture fund, so they can trade against you.</p>

<p>We strive to be independent and unbiased. We need to earn your trust. And to do that, we have to prove to you that the information we give you is of the highest quality and not tainted by some ulterior motive.</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="how-does-stockflare-make-money"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> How does Stockflare make money?</h3>

<p>Sadly we don’t.</p>

<p>At least not yet. Again, it’s one of those horrible problems of being a startup.</p>

<p>Once we’ve got to a sufficient size, we’ll start making money. But it’s still some time away. When we get there, we won’t be any different to other information businesses, with advertising, subscriptions, fairs and other value added services.</p>

<p>But for now, we are investing our own money, every day, in building and running Stockflare.</p>

</div>

<a class="faq-anchor" name="is-investing-simple"></a>

<div class="widget small-xs-left-margin small-xs-bottom-margin small-xs-padding">

<h3 class="strong small-xs-bottom-margin"> You say investing is simple. Is it?</h3>

<p>Yes, if you try.</p>

<p>As both Warren Buffett and Richard Oldfield are reported to have said. “Investing is simple, but not easy”. The main problem is ourselves. We get over excited, too confident, sloppy. When that happens we make mistakes.</p>

<p>For us, there are two golden rules to successful investing. Don’t lose what you’ve got. And grow it.</p>

<p>Simple as it sounds, they aren’t easy to stick to. If all your friends are piling into hot stocks or junk bonds, it’s difficult to resist. But trust your instincts and you’ll be fine.</p>

<p>Just remember what Fidelity Investments most successful fund manager, Peter Lynch recommends, “Know what you own, know why you own it…and never invest in a stock you can’t explain with a crayon”!</p>
